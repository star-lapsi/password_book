# password_book
中文说明:

本项目是本人的一个练手项目，目的是为了一边做一边学，一边了解C语言以及软件开发的内在组织方式。本项目的核心是一个简单那的密码信息保存功能，暂时没有考虑去搞个UI界面，就打算先从最基本的功能做起（输入输出、文件读写、增删改查等）。

本人没有任何开发项目经历，编程也仅仅局限于当年学的一点C语言，所以做出来的东西必然是问题一堆，很多细节也很难顾及，我自己也没有足够的时间细细去完善，makefile什么的还在学习阶段。

English Version: 

This project is a personal practice endeavor aimed at learning by doing while gaining an understanding of the C programming language and the organizational structure of software development. The core functionality of the project is a simple password information storage system. For now, I have not considered creating a UI interface and plan to focus on implementing basic features first (such as input/output, file reading/writing, and CRUD operations).

I have no prior experience in software development projects, and my programming knowledge is limited to the basic C language I learned in the past. Therefore, the resulting output will inevitably have numerous issues, and many details may be difficult to address. I also lack the time to meticulously refine the project, and I am still learning concepts like makefiles.(Translating by ChatGPT)
